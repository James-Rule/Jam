# Seals are the coolest
## But are they?

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#first chunk
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
compensation <- read.csv("data/compensation.csv")

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
